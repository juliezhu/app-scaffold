### modules
The modules directory is reserved for Sass code that doesn't cause Sass to actually output CSS. Things like mixin declarations, functions, and variables.

### partials
he partials directory is where to break stylesheets into header, content, sidebar, and footer components. Or break things down into much finer categories as typography, buttons, textboxes, selectboxes, etc. .

### Vendor
